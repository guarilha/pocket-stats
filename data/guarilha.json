I run a game store which hosts events and serves the local community here in Brooklyn, but also sells games and collectibles online and at shows/conventions.\nWhen Square came out with their portable credit card reader, I was very excited to adopt this technology. In exchange for a little under 3% of each transaction, they provided a way to turn my cell phone and my iPad into credit card machines. Portable, convenient, reliable. What’s not to like?\nI loved the product. I carried the Square reader with me any time I traveled to events, and used it to complete hundreds of transactions. I told everyone who would listen how it was the best thing since sliced bread.  When the regular credit card terminal at my store broke down, I used Square while waiting for a replacement terminal to arrive.\n“Wouldn’t it be great,” I mused, “if Square added a way to accept credit cards online, so I could use them for e-commerce, too.” And, sure enough, they did. It was easy to use, and I eagerly set up their service as the way to process all orders on my store’s web site. This was in July of 2013, and for a few months everything was good. Then the trouble began.\nIn November 2013, someone used stolen credit card numbers to place several large orders on my site.  Before I or anyone else caught on, my staff ended up shipping approximately $1800 worth of trading cards to different addresses provided by these thieves. The addresses weren’t even in the same state, and the transactions weren’t so out of line with other orders placed through the site for us to become suspicious.\nThe first time I knew there was a problem was in mid-November, when I received two chargeback notices from Square, totaling nearly $1200.  Here’s what a chargeback means: A consumer finds fraudulent transactions on their credit card and notifies the credit card company. They then contact the processor"}}},{"item_id":"545292639","resolved_id":"544737865","given_url":"http://hndigest.us2.list-manage1.com/track/click?u=b22d872dfc4ed1e70013427be&id=058ce650eb&e=d3ee87a913","given_title":"","favorite":"0","status":"1","time_added":"1392206304","time_updated":"1399746675","time_read":"1399746549","time_favorited":"0","sort_id":911,"resolved_title":"Yelp’s got style (and the guide to back it up)","resolved_url":"http://engineeringblog.yelp.com/2014/02/yelps-got-style-and-the-guide-to-back-it-up.html","excerpt":"We’re excited to publicly share Yelp’s styleguide — a living document that we’ve used internally since May 2013 to create visual consistency across Yelp and reduce technical debt with modular, reusable markup and styles.","is_article":"1","is_index":"0","has_video":"0","has_image":"1","word_count":"690","authors":{"11878899":{"item_id":"545292639","author_id":"11878899","name":"Molly F.","url":""}},"image":{"item_id":"545292639","src":"https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/7DHd2AEOTORSBYDzhk1dbMec8uvdbVeXAIV-S7AbIE3Ckc7TW3fatlHxQ0Q_4iwOWfBIGhsPUowfXJ1WTUoXIItW9W5dsFo2He7oieOiEOPbdjqBDE7lDIk1ZA","width":"624","height":"165"},"images":{"1":{"item_id":"545292639","image_id":"1","src":"https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/7DHd2AEOTORSBYDzhk1dbMec8uvdbVeXAIV-S7AbIE3Ckc7TW3fatlHxQ0Q_4iwOWfBIGhsPUowfXJ1WTUoXIItW9W5dsFo2He7oieOiEOPbdjqBDE7lDIk1ZA","width":"624","height":"165","credit":"","caption":""},"2":{"item_id":"545292639","image_id":"2","src":"https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/7SlGLHZLUdS_sXdUKPqbaEfd9672iNW5ygVZhqqf4-s96Cv0vPpDrb_iilxOoUEEiDI2TTJj9nUzgxwbs6cYF2oqwDKlGee1gz3ZAC1uPnsDjvQKgmxrelD2wg","width":"509","height":"350","credit":"","caption":""},"3":{"item_id":"545292639","image_id":"3","src":"https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/b1w5hZ24cbwnJNPJv3OjvxMwD8guiVaxVLoeLBpTa_6lYiMK_-vxpUa7jPlOKBpQ3ft_5IykdAi81_s6OInaqCe_V-8I0mrDFlApc9Z23UaVp4mY_cP-4EM7bw","width":"552","height":"209","credit":"","caption":""}}},{"item_id":"545292778","resolved_id":"515261231","given_url":"http://hndigest.us2.list-manage.com/track/click?u=b22d872dfc4ed1e70013427be&id=df49e83248&e=d3ee87a913","given_title":"","favorite":"0","status":"0","time_added":"1392206317","time_updated":"1392206319","time_read":"0","time_favorited":"0","sort_id":910,"resolved_title":"Responsive Javascript","resolved_url":"http://www.responsivejavascript.com/","excerpt":"Responsive Javascript is the title given to Javascript which reacts to the state of the browser.
